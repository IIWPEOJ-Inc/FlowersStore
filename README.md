<<<<<<< HEAD
Let's essume you need to complete one of the tasks:\
[Issue-008] Checkout page implementation.

[Feature], [Bug], [Refactoring] branches opens from origin/master.\
[Subtask] branches opens from any branch but origin/master.

to name branch use your task title:
{task-type}/{issue-number}/{short-descripton}\
for example: main/feature/issue-121/sign-in-pop-up-implementation\
or subtask for branch above:\
{parent-issue-number}/subtask/{issue-number}/{short-descripton}\
issue-121/subtask/issue-122/sign-in-pop-up-desktop-implementation
